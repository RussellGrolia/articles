# Maslow's hierarchy of needs

## 1. Explanation

### Hypothesis (3)

1. Organism, including human, cannot live if without needs. Human's action is motivated by his needs in order to live. Only unsatisfied needs affect action by the effect of motivation.
2. The "needs" can be arranged to level with importance, from basic to complex.
3. Human cannot go up to satisfy high-level needs without the minimal satisfaction of all low-level needs. The process of trying to meet more needs act as inner power to strive.

### Attached Hypothesis

1. Needs in different level motivate human action at the same time, however the highest level acts as the most significate one.
2. The needs are mostly unconscious to human. However the unconscious motivation  takes up most of the decision of human. So that they are more important than conscious motivation.
